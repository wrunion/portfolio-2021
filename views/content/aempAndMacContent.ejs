Portfolio 2021 Content:

I discovered the Mapping Action Collective through a site called Rose City Resource. A collaboration with the Portland non-profit Street Roots, the Rose City Resource Guide is an online collection of resources for houseless people all across Oregon. 

It’s a searchable site where people can find the resources they need, and it caught my eye right away. 

I said to myself, “I need to meet the people who wrote this code.” So I emailed them, and then I did. 

That’s the story of how I met the two founders of MAC a year ago, and I’ve been working with them full time ever since.

At MAC I am currently:
- Creating documentation for the administrative login system I created for the Rose City Resource Guide last winter.
- Redesigning said login system, which involves designing with Figma, and then bringing my designs to life using Node, Express, and CSS, and EJS. 
- I’m also Product Owner on a second cousin project: The Oregon Youth Resource Map, which is a collaboration with Portland Statue University and the national mental health grant, Healthy Transitions. 
- I’m the lead UX/UI designer for the Oregon Youth Resource Map. In a small team of 4, I also wear more hats than that, including Product Owner, but the role I most enjoy and excel at is UX/UI development.
- For Healthy Transitions, I use these technologies: 
    - Figma
    - Adobe XD
    - HTML/CSS/JavaScript
    - React
    - Node, Express, and Passport, to create a backend admin login system, for our clients to update their site data in real time
    - EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates), which allows me to reproduce React-like functionality with simplicity, and from the server side.

I have also worked with the Mapping Action Collective’s sister group, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project (AEMP.) This California group uses mapping technology to fight against eviction and gentrification in the wake of the Silicon Valley housing rush that pushed many long-time California residents out of their homes. 

The Anti Eviction Mapping Tool (also known as “Evictorbook”) is an ongoing project with a team of 15+ people from all disciplines. 

On the Anti Eviction Mapping Tool I:

UX/UI Design and Development:
- Trained under a UX developer with 7 years of industry experience
- Learned to organize, conduct, and analyze user interviews
- Took part in all stages of the UX Design process, from idea, to wireframes, to writing the code myself and actualizing the designs on the live site.

Front End Development: 
- I also worked on the front end, using React the component libraries Antd Design and Material UI to create an accessible, mobile-friendly web application.
- I conducted a thorough accessibility audit of the application, then implemented the changes step by step, working with a team of 2-3.
- I also consulted on API design, and took part in collaborative design session with the data leads, as we worked together to solve tricky design challenges in 2 hours or less. (We always came out with a working design, and the problem in hand.) 

This mapping tool is not yet available for public viewing, but these images highlight the "eviction search" feature of the site. 

(Show code for the tables, before and after I got to it. Show an image of the mobile footer, and/or the entire site in mobile. Show the search bar.)
