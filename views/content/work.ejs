    <p>
      The Anti Eviction Mapping Tool (also known as “Evictorbook”) is an ongoing project with a team of 15+ people from all disciplines. 
    </p>

    <p>
      On the Anti Eviction Mapping Tool I:
    </p>

    UX/UI Design and Development:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trained under a UX developer with 7 years of industry experience
      </li>
      <li>
        Learned to organize, conduct, and analyze user interviews
      </li>
      <li>
        Took part in all stages of the UX Design process, from idea, to wireframes, to writing the code myself and actualizing the designs on the live site.
      </li>
    </ul>


Front End Development: 
<ul>
  <li>
    I also worked on the front end, using React the component libraries Antd Design and Material UI to create an accessible, mobile-friendly web application.
  </li>
  <li>
    I conducted a thorough accessibility audit of the application, then implemented the changes step by step, working with a team of 3.
  </li>
  <li>
    I also consulted on API design, and took part in collaborative design session with the data leads.

    <p>
      In 2020 I completed the JavaScript/React Front End Development Program at one of Portland's best known, in-person bootcamps: Epicodus. 
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      For my capstone project, I chose an area that's long been a passion of mine: helping people find the resources they need. I found an open-data API from New York City, that gave information about 1000+ social service resources available to women in NYC. These services provide everything from sports opportunities to health care, but most people don't know how to search an online database, which is hard to find in the first place. 
    </p> -->
    <p>
      For my Capstone Project, I created <a href="https://wrunion.github.io/epicodus-capstone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NYC Women's Social Service Resource Finder</a>.

      Rose City Resource Guide
    </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    After Epicodus, I continued studying the User Experience Design of resource websites. My research led me to the Rose City Resource Guide, a collaboration with the Portland non-profit Street Roots, and the Mapping Action Collective. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    It’s a searchable site where people can find the resources they need, and it caught my eye right away.

  </div>

  <p>
    I said to myself, “I need to meet the people who wrote this code.” So I emailed them, and then I did. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    That’s the story of how I met the two founders of the Mapping Action Collective a year ago, and I’ve been working with them full time ever since.
  </p>

 <p>
  At MAC I am currently:
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>
    Creating documentation for the administrative login system I created for the Rose City Resource Guide last winter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Redesigning said login system, which involves designing with Figma, and then bringing my designs to life using Node, Express, and CSS, and EJS. 
  </li>
  <!-- possibly make this its own project??? with the in-progress wireframes, once they're ready to view???  -->
  <li>
    I’m also Product Owner on a second cousin project: The Oregon Youth Resource Map, which is a collaboration with Portland Statue University and the national mental health grant, Healthy Transitions. 
  </li>
  <li>
    I’m the lead UX/UI designer for the Oregon Youth Resource Map. In a small team of 4, I also wear more hats than that, including Product Owner, but the role I most enjoy and excel at is UX/UI development.
  </li>
 </ul>

 For Healthy Transitions, I use these technologies: 
 <ul>
   <li>
    Figma
   </li>
   <li>
    Adobe XD
   </li>
   <li>
    HTML/CSS/JavaScript
   </li>
   <li>
    React
   </li>
   <li>
    EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates), which allows me to reproduce React-like functionality with simplicity, and from the server side.
   </li>
   <li>
    Node, Express, and Passport, to create a backend admin login system, for our clients to update their site data in real time
   </li>
 </ul>
