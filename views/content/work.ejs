      Epicodus Capstone

  <p>
    In 2020 I completed the JavaScript/React Front End Development Program at one of Portland's best known, in-person bootcamps: Epicodus. 
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
    For my capstone project, I chose an area that's long been a passion of mine: helping people find the resources they need. I found an open-data API from New York City, that gave information about 1000+ social service resources available to women in NYC. These services provide everything from sports opportunities to health care, but most people don't know how to search an online database, which is hard to find in the first place. 
  </p> -->
  <p>
    For my Capstone Project, I created <a href="https://wrunion.github.io/epicodus-capstone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NYC Women's Social Service Resource Finder</a>.
  </p>
  <p style="color: grey">

  </p>
  <p>
    The app allows users to search by up to three different categories, and a New York neighborhood, and then see resources that meet those requirements.

  <p>
    After Epicodus, I continued studying the User Experience Design of resource websites. My research led me to the Rose City Resource Guide, a collaboration with the Portland non-profit Street Roots, and the Mapping Action Collective. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    It’s a searchable site where people can find the resources they need, and it caught my eye right away. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I said to myself, “I need to meet the people who wrote this code.” So I emailed them, and then I did. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    That’s the story of how I met the two founders of the Mapping Action Collective a year ago, and I’ve been working with them full time ever since.
